            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <p>4-6 eggs (boiled and peeled)</p>
                <p>2 onions (finely chopped)</p>
                <p>2 tomatoes (pureed or finely chopped)</p>
                <p>1-2 green chilies (slit) , 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste</p>
                <p>1 tsp cumin seeds , 1/2 tsp turmeric powder</p>
                <p>1 tsp red chili powder , 1 tsp coriander powder</p>
                <p>1/2 tsp garam masala , 1/2 tsp cumin powder</p>
                <p>Fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves for garnish , 2-3 tbsp oil </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <p>1.Boil the eggs: Hard-boil the eggs in water. Once boiled, peel and set aside. You can make small slits or prick the eggs with a fork to allow the flavors to penetrate while cooking.</p>
                <p>Fry the eggs (optional): Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan, lightly fry the boiled eggs until golden. This step adds extra flavor but is optional.</p>
                <p>Prepare the base: In the same pan, heat 2-3 tbsp of oil.
                    Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle.
                    Add the chopped onions and green chilies, sauté until golden brown.
                    Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</p>
                <p>Add spices and tomatoes: Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Stir well.
                    Add the tomato puree or finely chopped tomatoes. Cook until the oil separates from the mixture, and the tomatoes become soft.</p>
                <p>Make the gravy: Add water (around 1 to 1.5 cups) to the mixture, adjusting the consistency of the gravy as per your preference. Let it simmer for 5-7 minutes.
                    Add garam masala and kasuri methi (if using), and stir.</p>
                <p>Add eggs: Gently add the boiled eggs to the gravy.
                    Cook for another 5 minutes on low heat, allowing the eggs to absorb the flavors.</p>
                <p>Garnish: Turn off the heat and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</p>
